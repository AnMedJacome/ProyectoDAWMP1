Despite continually facing failure in her quest for love, her spirits have never dampened. At the age of 20, she finds herself on a train to Tokyo with hopes of reuniting with her current boyfriend. Nana Osaki, on the other hand, is feisty and prideful. After joining a local band during her high school days, she falls in love with music and one of the band members. However, when faced with the choice between her relationship and her musical career, she chooses the latter and separates from her boyfriend. On her 20th birthday, she boards the same train to Tokyo, like her namesake, where she aims to become a top vocalist. The two girls with the same name but very different aspirations find themselves sitting together on their journey to the city, and, as fate would have it, eventually share the same apartment. A deep and unique bond is then forged, where they will support each other in this saga of love, music, friendship, and heartbreak.

In February 2004, Viz Media announced they had acquired the series, and released the manga in English from April 21, 2004 to July 5, 2011. The manga has received multiple media adaptations. Since the Golden Week of 2003, Marvelous Entertainment has produced a series of musicals that are shown bi-annually, with each musical adapting one arc of the manga storyline. A live adaptation film was released in Japan on May 13, 2006, covering the storyline from when Ryoma arrives in Japan to the match against Hyotei Academy. Three Chinese dramas have been produced. Due to localization, the dramas feature different characters and cultural themes, but the story and characters' portrayal remain similar to the manga. A variety of video games based on the series, mostly tennis games or dating simulators, have been released in Japan across multiple consoles. A half-hour weekly radio show was also produced, featuring over 300 music CDs along with a large range of merchandise.","authors":[{"mal_id":1909,"type":"people","name":"Konomi, Takeshi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/people\/1909\/Takeshi_Konomi"}],"serializations":[{"mal_id":83,"type":"manga","name":"Shounen Jump (Weekly)","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/magazine\/83\/Shounen_Jump_Weekly"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":30,"type":"manga","name":"Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/30\/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"manga","name":"School","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/23\/School"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"manga","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":50,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/50\/Shaman_King","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/255376.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/255376t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/255376l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/255376.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/255376t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/2\/255376l.webp"}},"title":"Shaman King","title_english":"Shaman King","title_japanese":"\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30de\u30f3\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0","title_synonyms":["Exotica","Funbari no Uta","The Poem of Funbari","The Song of Funbari"],"type":"Manga","chapters":288,"volumes":32,"status":"Finished","publishing":false,"published":{"from":"1998-06-30T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2004-08-30T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":30,"month":6,"year":1998},"to":{"day":30,"month":8,"year":2004}},"string":"Jun 30, 1998 to Aug 30, 2004"},"score":7.81,"scored":7.81,"scored_by":33773,"rank":1152,"popularity":179,"members":67954,"favorites":3212,"synopsis":"Shamans are extraordinary individuals with the ability to communicate with ghosts, spirits, and gods, which are invisible to ordinary people.

However, his reputation for delinquency and destructiveness precedes him, and most of his fellow students subsequently avoid him like the plague. As his first day of school ends, he is left with two strong thoughts: \"I hate basketball\" and \"I need a girlfriend.\" Haruko Akagi, ignorant of Hanamichi's history of misbehavior, notices his immense height and unwittingly approaches him, asking whether or not he likes basketball. Overcome by the fact that a girl is speaking to him, the red-haired giant blurts out a yes despite his true feelings. At the gym, Haruko asks if he can do a slam dunk. Though a complete novice, Hanamachi palms the ball and makes the leap...but overshoots, slamming his head into the backboard. Amazed by his near-inhuman physical abilities, Haruko quickly notifies the school's basketball captain of his feat. With this, Hanamichi is unexpectedly thrust into a world of competition for a girl he barely knows, but he soon discovers that there is perhaps more to basketball than he once thought.
