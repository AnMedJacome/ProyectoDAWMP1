She is in the city to go to school, somethings her parents wanted her to do. Futaba quickly becomes entangled in the relationship between Zakuru, the guy who she lives with and is doing the cooking for, and his friend Masato. Masato is very nice to Futaba, but what is his relationship with Zakuru? The next story is about a 17 year old tomboy named Natsume who realizes she has feelings for a childhood friend of hers.
