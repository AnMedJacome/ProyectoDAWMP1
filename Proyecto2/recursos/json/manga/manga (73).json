Prior to the traffic accident, she originally had two personalities, a male personality named Shiki (\u7e54), and the original female personality Shiki (\u5f0f). Children born into the Ryougi family are generally male and are raised with two personalities, so the male personality is customarily called the \"yang\" personality, while the female is called the \"yin\" personality. It is easy to tell which Shiki is speaking at a given time because they both have a distinct style of speaking, most notably that the female Shiki refers to herself with the pronoun watashi (\u79c1), while male Shiki refers to himself as ore (\u4ffa). After waking from her coma, Shiki discovers that she can no longer feel the male Shiki's presence and assumes that he died because of the accident. She also feels a detachment from her memories before the accident, and while she knows she is Shiki, she does not feel that she is. In the hopes of regaining herself and the \"dead\" Shiki, she puts on a cold facade that somewhat resembles the male Shiki's and tries to act as the female Shiki did. Touko understands the sense of detachment Shiki feels, but considers the current Shiki a third, new personality. The series is regarded as being set in the same world as another TYPE-MOON series, Tsukihime, with Aoko Aozaki's sister Touko Aozaki being featured in this series and the protagonist of the series, Shiki Ryougi, possessing the same abilities as Tsukihime's protagonist, Shiki Tohno.

In 'Yokubou Shounen', there's only one story that takes us to the fantastic; the rest are tales about more or less ordinary people. In the first two one-shots we'll get to meet a teacher, Matsunae Suguru, and his handsome, self-searching young student Shinobu, and then again Shinobu, causing confusion between his two schoolmates, Hideya and Makoto, who are hopelessly in love - but sweetly clueless about how to get it going. The third story, 'Love Snatcher', is an absolutely gorgeous fantasy. Once again Naono-sensei proves her skill at drawing animals, and the mysterious Tigure is truly an eyeful. The last two one-shots are very emotional, painted with doubt and misunderstandings, and the fact that Naono-sensei is a master at creating unique individuals really shows this time as well. Consists of a collection of oneshots: 1) A Desire Boy (Yokubou Shounen) 2) Sawaki's Case 3) Love Snatcher- After getting fired from his job half Japanese Tanaka Tatsuaki drunkenly prays to the moon to take him away, and it does! He's been summoned to a land of shape-shifters to be the bride of Tigure, lord of the tigers. And he's expected to give birth? 4) Love and Reticence (Ai to Chinmoku)-Nearly silent ghost writer Kisa has fallen in love with a small out of the way diner and the delicious food there. But handsome owner-san wants more from Kisa than his patronage. 5) Drowning in Love (Oboreru Kankei)- Yoshino Keiichi's life has gotten a lot more interesting since single father Kayumi Takamasa and his two young children moved in next door. Keiichi's become a mother to the youngsters, but his relationship with their father is much more complex...
