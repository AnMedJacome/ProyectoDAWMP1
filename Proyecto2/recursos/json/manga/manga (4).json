They are soon greeted by Guru Clef, a youthful-looking man who informs them that they are the legendary Magic Knights summoned by Princess Emeraude to save this magical land known as Cephiro. While Hikaru finds the prospect exciting, Umi and Fuu simply want to return to their own world. Unfortunately for them, Clef explains that they cannot go home until they have saved Cephiro and banished the monsters plaguing it. In order to do so, they have to rescue Princess Emeraude from the clutches of the powerful Lord Zagato. To stand a chance against him, they must revive mysterious beings called Mashin. As Clef grants the trio armor and magic, one of Zagato's servants attacks, forcing the guru to send the girls away to the weaponsmith Presea and the rabbit-like guide Mokona, who can further equip them for their journey. Though they have a long way to go, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu will show that they have what it takes to live up to their titles as Magic Knights and bring salvation to Cephiro.

The store's proprietor is an enigmatic young man who goes by the name of Count D. Count D welcomes those who feel lonely and wounded through the doors of his shop, claiming to sell \"love, dreams, and hope\" in the form of the fantastic beasts that lie within. Each creature comes with a special contract accompanied by a set of rules. However, he warns customers that he cannot be held accountable for any consequences of breaking the rules. Short-tempered detective Leon Orcot traces the source of several crimes back to Count D and what the former considers to be a pet shop of horrors. Determined to find proof that the Count is a criminal, he begins to pay regular visits to the shop.
