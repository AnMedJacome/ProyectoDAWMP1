The author Yoshito Usui was reported missing after leaving for a hiking trip on September 11, 2009, and later his body was found by a climber at Mt. Arafune on September 19. Publication of Crayon Shin-chan was expected to end in November of 2009, but was extended to the March 2010 issue, due to discovered new manuscripts. Several different publishers have released Crayon Shin-chan in English over the years. It was first introduced to an English-speaking readership in the educational publication Mangajin, wherein it ran occasionally from February 1993 to September 1997, for a total of 9 issues. Later, it was published in book format, first by ComicsOne who released the first volume on October 1, 2002. This version included many changes from the original, such as name changes, censorship, and pop-culture references, as well as flipping the orientation to a left-to-right format. DC Comics' manga division CMX published 11 volumes in its uncensored and un-flipped format from February 1, 2008 to May 4, 2010, although many name changes and cultural references remained altered. One Peace Books released four volumes in a 3-in-1 omnibus format from October 5, 2012 to November 15, 2013.
