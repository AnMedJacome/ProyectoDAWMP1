It is also during a fictitious era called \"The Era of the Cooking Wars.\" It was an era in which top chefs with different cooking styles tried their best to improve their skills and to become the best chef in China. It is a country where insulting a high-grade chef or fooling around with cooking could land a person in a jail, and impersonating a top-chef is as good as usurpation of authority. Chefs compete with each other in order to gain respect and even power, but also with the risks of losing everything. After the death of Mao's mother, Pai, who was called the 'Fairy of Cuisine,' Mao becomes a Super Chef in order to take the title as Master Chef of his mother's restaurant. However, before he takes his mother's place as Master Chef, he continues to travel China in order to learn more of the many ways of cooking, in the hopes of becoming a legendary chef, just like his mother. During his journey, he meets great friends and fierce rivals who wish to challenge him in the field of cooking.

While a young boy, just resurrected as a vampire, commits acts of awful ferocity, the city around him shows all its perversion. The adults abuse their power, the boys degenerate and use all the available means to achieve their goal to give vent to their low instincts. Whoever can't understand and make opposition is doomed to change or becoming crazy. So which is the real horror? The vampire who kills in order to feed himself or the crawling disease hidden in society, which slowy corrupts without being noticed? Volume 2 : Paradise. Following the events narrated in the first volume, Luna and Konosuke are now living together with the old woman vampire as fellows, as lovers, in a diabolic innocence, killing for quieting their thirst for blood, joining death and love under the dream of eternal youth. Meanwhile, a young boy named Makoto is looking for his lost sister Miko, who disappeared years ago in mysterious circumstances. But what really happened to that girl who liked eating grubs and dreamed of becoming one of them? And is there really a terrible secret that someone is hiding? The paths of all the characters will dramatically collide, bringing unexpected consequences after the things are gradually revealed. A story suspended between weirdness and decadence, showing a clear nostalgia for German cinematography and Federico Fellini, where blood is used to trace a great and only apparently amoral story.
