You's mother is not in the picture, having left when You was very young. Also living with You and her father is her younger brother Sunny, who is very attached to his older sister and tends to follow her everywhere she goes, including to school and to her volleyball matches. You is also curious about Kyushi Tajima, the pretty blonde woman whom she sees covering volleyball games on television, and about why her father becomes very angry whenever You mentions her. You is passionate about volleyball and dreams of one day being a part of Japan's national women's volleyball team in the 1988 Seoul Olympics. She joins her school's girls' volleyball team and quickly becomes one of the top players, although her coach (who is also her homeroom teacher) is brutal and literally slaps his players around when they don't live up to his expectations. You begins a tumultuous friendship with former school volleyball champ and former arch-rival Nami Hayase (French name: \"Peggy\"), which comes to a head when the two girls join opposing professional teams. She also develops a crush on So Takiki, the captain of the Hikawa boys' volleyball team (known as \"Shiro,\" \"Serge\" or \"Sergio\" in various Western versions), and puts as much effort into trying to win his heart as she does into her game.","background":null,"authors":[{"mal_id":3130,"type":"people","name":"Makimura, Jun","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/people\/3130\/Jun_Makimura"}],"serializations":[{"mal_id":20,"type":"manga","name":"Nakayoshi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/magazine\/20\/Nakayoshi"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":22,"type":"manga","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/22\/Romance"},{"mal_id":30,"type":"manga","name":"Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/30\/Sports"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":78,"type":"manga","name":"Team Sports","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/78\/Team_Sports"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":25,"type":"manga","name":"Shoujo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/genre\/25\/Shoujo"}]},{"mal_id":1652,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/manga\/1652\/Shanghai_Youma_Kikai","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/1727.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/1727t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/1727l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/1727.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/1727t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/manga\/1\/1727l.webp"}},"title":"Shanghai Youma Kikai","title_english":null,"title_japanese":"\u4e0a\u6d77\u5996\u9b54\u9b3c\u602a","title_synonyms":["Demons of Shanghai"],"type":"Manga","chapters":4,"volumes":null,"status":"Finished","publishing":false,"published":{"from":"2000-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2006-04-12T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":12,"month":4,"year":2000},"to":{"day":12,"month":4,"year":2006}},"string":"Apr 12, 2000 to Apr 12, 2006"},"score":7.02,"scored":7.02,"scored_by":827,"rank":7562,"popularity":7554,"members":1901,"favorites":6,"synopsis":"In the year 2050 AD, Humans live in a world filled with science and electronics, but the \"Demon Capital\" Shanghai has never been rid of demons.

They enjoyed a level of technology much higher than is currently known and sent explorers to the far reaches of the Joker Galaxy. Around the year 9000 AD (Ammon Duul) the empire collapsed due to internal strife. The explorers were called home and what remained of civilization focused mainly on survival. Much technology and knowledge was lost by the time the imperial families of Amaterasu, Fillmore and Hathuha gathered and established the JC era. JC stands for \"Joker Calendar\" and was meant to give a common frame of reference to all nations to help foster a lasting peace. The JC calendar was adopted but the dream of peace was never realized. The first story of The Five Star Stories begins in JC 2988. At this time interstellar travel is common and genetically engineered \"fatimas\" are well established as necessary co-pilots of the fearsome mortar headds that dominate the battlefields.

Separated at birth until second grade, Ageha had grown up in the countryside, being raised by her grandmother, while Hana lived in the city with their parents. Due to their contrasting upbringings, the quiet and reserved Ageha constantly lives in the shadow of her outgoing and charismatic sister. During her childhood, Ageha befriended a boy named Ryuusei Koike and has been in love with him since. When she moved back in with her parents, the two lost contact with each other, but she was surprised to see him again in high school. Even so, she cannot bring herself to talk to him, much less confess her love for him. Seeing her woes, a mysterious man tells Ageha if she proclaims her love out loud, then Ryuusei will surely return her feelings. Thinking he is delusional, Ageha humors the idea, only for Ryuusei to enter the room and remember their childhood together. Their reunion is short-lived, however, when Hana decides to swoop in and steal Ryuusei from Ageha out of jealousy. Just when she loses hope of ever being with him, the stranger from before reappears, promising to help Ageha take Ryuusei back.
