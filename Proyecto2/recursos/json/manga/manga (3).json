Their families, however, were not very supportive of this match. Both children have parents who work as models and to whom they owe their good looks. The trouble is, Kiri inherited chiseled masculine features from her father and Tohya inherited his mother's delicate beauty. For years, Kiri has been working hard toward becoming a girl worthy of Tohya, but even now, she faces constant reminders that everyone regards her as unsuitable for him due to her lack of femininity. One day, Tohya is scouted by a fashion photographer and agrees to work as a model for the agency owned by Kiri's mother. Kiri is concerned that Tohya will be preyed upon by other men in the fashion world, and so she begs her mother to hire her as well. Her wish is granted with a twist, as she is forced to pose as a male model under the name \"Tatsuki.\" During their first photo shoot, it seems that Kiri's worries are well-founded when the photographer won't keep his hands off Tohya. With the desire to protect Tohya warring against the fear that she will appear undesirable to him the longer she pretends to be male, Kiri must come to terms with her identity and decide if outer beauty is really more important than what lies inside.
