After a short fight with the smoking, bad-tempered rabbit, Usahara, Uruno decides that he wants to move on... but changes his mind upon meeting Chiiko, a clumsy cheetah girl. It's love at first sight for Uruno, and after deciding to stay for her, he continues to hope that even though he's a good-for-nothing, he'll win her over someday. That is, if living with the other strange residents of the forest-- including the aformentioned smoking rabbit, a sake-drinking unicorn, a near-sighted eagle, an orca that cannot swim, and a shy pegasus --doesn't get to him first.","background":null,"season":"winter","year":2005,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":147,"type":"anime","name":"SKY Perfect Well Think","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/147\/SKY_Perfect_Well_Think"},{"mal_id":158,"type":"anime","name":"Kids Station","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/158\/Kids_Station"},{"mal_id":332,"type":"anime","name":"Takeshobo","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/332\/Takeshobo"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":207,"type":"anime","name":"Magic Bus","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/207\/Magic_Bus"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":51,"type":"anime","name":"Anthropomorphic","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/51\/Anthropomorphic"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":486,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/486\/Kino_no_Tabi__The_Beautiful_World","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1763\/95397.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1763\/95397t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1763\/95397l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1763\/95397.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1763\/95397t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1763\/95397l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"title":"Kino no Tabi: The Beautiful World","title_english":"Kino's Journey","title_japanese":"\u30ad\u30ce\u306e\u65c5 -the Beautiful World-","title_synonyms":["Kino's Travels: The Beautiful World"],"type":"TV","source":"Light novel","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2003-04-08T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2003-07-08T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":8,"month":4,"year":2003},"to":{"day":8,"month":7,"year":2003}},"string":"Apr 8, 2003 to Jul 8, 2003"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"R - 17+ (violence & profanity)","score":8.29,"scored_by":87280,"rank":248,"popularity":721,"members":275972,"favorites":6212,"synopsis":"Kino, a 15-year-old traveler, forms a bond with Hermes, a talking motorcycle.

Throughout their journeys, they encounter different kinds of customs, from the morally gray to tragic and fascinating. They also meet many people: some who live to work, some who live to make others happy, and some who live to chase their dreams. Thus, in every country they visit, there is always something to learn from the way people carry out their lives. It is not up to Kino or Hermes to decide whether these asserted values are wrong or right, as they merely assume the roles of observers within this small world. They do not attempt to change or influence the places they visit, despite how absurd these values would appear. That's because in one way or another, they believe things are fine as they are, and that \"the world is not beautiful; therefore, it is.\" [Written by MAL Rewrite]","background":null,"season":"spring","year":2003,"broadcast":{"day":"Tuesdays","time":"18:30","timezone":"Asia\/Tokyo","string":"Tuesdays at 18:30 (JST)"},"producers":[{"mal_id":33,"type":"anime","name":"WOWOW","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/33\/WOWOW"},{"mal_id":79,"type":"anime","name":"Genco","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/79\/Genco"},{"mal_id":144,"type":"anime","name":"Pony Canyon","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/144\/Pony_Canyon"},{"mal_id":412,"type":"anime","name":"Studio Wombat","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/412\/Studio_Wombat"},{"mal_id":665,"type":"anime","name":"chara-ani.com","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/665\/chara-anicom"},{"mal_id":681,"type":"anime","name":"ASCII Media Works","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/681\/ASCII_Media_Works"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":97,"type":"anime","name":"ADV Films","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/97\/ADV_Films"},{"mal_id":376,"type":"anime","name":"Sentai Filmworks","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/376\/Sentai_Filmworks"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":179,"type":"anime","name":"A.C.G.T.","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/179\/ACGT"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":36,"type":"anime","name":"Slice of Life","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/36\/Slice_of_Life"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":63,"type":"anime","name":"Iyashikei","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/63\/Iyashikei"},{"mal_id":40,"type":"anime","name":"Psychological","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/40\/Psychological"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":487,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/487\/Girls_Bravo__Second_Season","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/20149.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/20149t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/20149l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/20149.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/20149t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/7\/20149l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"title":"Girls Bravo: Second Season","title_english":"Girls Bravo: Second Season","title_japanese":"GIRLS\u30d6\u30e9\u30dc\u30fc second season","title_synonyms":[],"type":"TV","source":"Manga","episodes":13,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"2005-01-27T00:00:00+00:00","to":"2005-04-21T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":27,"month":1,"year":2005},"to":{"day":21,"month":4,"year":2005}},"string":"Jan 27, 2005 to Apr 21, 2005"},"duration":"23 min per ep","rating":"R+ - Mild Nudity","score":6.62,"scored_by":46491,"rank":5728,"popularity":1949,"members":85921,"favorites":121,"synopsis":"Small for his age, Yukinari has been bullied and abused by girls all his life.

In a bid to raise their social status, their servant, a robotic cat named Doraemon, decides to travel back in time and guide Nobita on the proper path to fortune. Unfortunately Doraemon, a dysfunctional robot that the familly acquired by accident (but chose to keep nonetheless), isn't much better off than Nobita. The robot leads Nobita on many adventures, and while Nobita's life certainly is more exciting with the robot cat from the future, it is questionable if it is in fact better in the way that Doraemon planned.

Nearly all the footage within the series (except for the opening and closing credits) was destroyed in an accidental fire sometime after the series was cancelled.
