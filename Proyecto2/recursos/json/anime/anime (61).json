In this age, there are two developed worlds; \"the real world\" and \"wired\", or the virtual network world.

During this attack, he loses Nonomura Yuya, his friend as well as the team leader. Toru is arrested by the army. In exchange for letting him free, he has to work for an anti-hacker organization, the first squad of the UN Security Force Information Administration Bureau.
