In order to try and salvage what little of the human race is left, large force-field barriers have been constructed around certain cities to repel the Phantoms. Seeking a more permanent solution to this invasion are scientists Aki Ross and her mentor, Dr. Sid, whose investigations have revealed that there exists a form of spiritual, Gaia energy that can eradicate the Phantom's presence from this world. Aki and Sid aren't alone in their quest through Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within; the human council and the military squad \"Deep Eyes\" are ready to help. Not everyone is convinced of this plan though. Aki, Sid, Grey, and their allies have to band together against forces both alien and human if they are to have any chance at restoring peace to Earth. An enemy whose mere touch is fatal, the Phantoms appear the more dangerous enemy, but as they will come to find out, their human nemeses are also not to be trifled with.","background":"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within was the only full length film produced by Square Pictures. The movie's final budget was $137 million dollar budget, due to the high costs of the technology being used for the film's computer animation. With marketing costs included, The Spirits Within lost in excess of $94 million. Adjusted for 2016 inflation, this amounts to over $126 million. Not only did this directly lead to the closing of Square Pictures, but it also delayed the parent company Square from completing its planned merger with the video game publishing company Enix. A Japanese\/American collaboration, The Spirits Within was filmed in English and premiered in the United States two months before releasing in Japan.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":757,"type":"anime","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/757\/Sony_Music_Entertainment"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":58,"type":"anime","name":"Square Enix","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/58\/Square_Enix"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":1362,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/1362\/Street_Fighter_II_Movie","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/76411.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/76411t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/76411l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/76411.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/76411t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/8\/76411l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"wmRegQDCzlA","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wmRegQDCzlA","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/wmRegQDCzlA?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wmRegQDCzlA\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wmRegQDCzlA\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wmRegQDCzlA\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wmRegQDCzlA\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/wmRegQDCzlA\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"title":"Street Fighter II Movie","title_english":"Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie","title_japanese":"\u30b9\u30c8\u30ea\u30fc\u30c8\u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30bf\u30fcII MOVIE","title_synonyms":[],"type":"Movie","source":"Game","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1994-08-06T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":6,"month":8,"year":1994},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"Aug 6, 1994"},"duration":"1 hr 41 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":7.17,"scored_by":17333,"rank":3142,"popularity":3671,"members":27369,"favorites":123,"synopsis":"Get your quarters ready, because the world's top fighters are about to go head to head in this explosive animated adaptation of the classic Street Fighter II arcade game!

Bison's plan to crush those who would oppose his organization, Shadowloo, is simple: brainwash the strongest martial artists around with his dreaded psycho power, and turn them into living weapons! To stop him, Interpol agent Chun-Li must team up with Major Guile of the United States Air Force, but that's no small feat. They'll have to put aside their differences and learn to work together, and fast. Bison is closing in on Ryu, a traveling vagabond said to be the best fighter in the world.

The Resurrection In a distant future where Earth has become uninhabitable, Leona undergoes surgery on a space station to recover from a deadly accident.

The Sun After his faction loses the war, Prince Harima's head is replaced with a wolf's. An old medicine woman who recognizes his bloodline assists him and the wounded General Azumi-no-muraji Saruta in escaping to Wah Land. But their arrival at a small Wah village is met with unexpected trouble as Houben, a powerful Buddhist monk, wants Harima dead. With the aid of the Ku clan wolf gods that protect the village's surroundings, he survives the murder attempt. After tensions settle, Saruta uses his established reputation in Wah to persuade the villagers to welcome Harima into their community. Over a period of time, Harima becomes the village's respected leader under the name Inugami no Sukune. But while the young prince adapts to his new role, he must remain vigilant as new dangers soon arise and threaten his recently acquired tranquility.
