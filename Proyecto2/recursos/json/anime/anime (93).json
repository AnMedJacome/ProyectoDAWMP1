Several centuries ago in Nottingham County, a cruel and greedy baron by the name of Alwine ordered the destruction of the Huntingtons' castle\u2014from the fire of which Robin and his cousins, Will, Winifred and Barbara, miraculously escaped. The youngsters sought shelter in Sherwood Forest, where, thanks to the wise guidance of the hermit better known as \"Friar Tuck,\" they managed to face the difficulties of a life in the wilderness as as well as they could; however, in the forest there lived a fearless group of young bandits, led by Little John. Their first encounter with Robin and his cousins was at first rather stormy, as the two groups fought for the destiny of a young, noble maiden named Marian who had fallen into the hands of the bandits during an ambush. Their bitterness, however, rapidly lead the way to friendship, and Robin and John later realized they were all victims of the same fate. The youngsters thus mutually decided to help one another. Baron Alwine was not merely enemy of the Huntingtons\u2014in fact, a couple years earlier he had forced Little John and his gang to seek protection in the forest to avoid forced labour. He would later seek Marian Lancaster for the secret carved on a cross the girl wore as symbol of her family line. The girl was to be adopted by the shady Bishop Herfort\u2014Alwine's accomplice\u2014who sought to attain the Lancaster's wealth. With all their strength, Robin and his friends were then compelled to fight against the baron's troops, led by Gilbert\u2014a dangerous and fearless knight. When Winifred and Marian were then imprisoned in the castle's dungeons, our heroes tried in every way possible to enter until their ardour was finally rewarded with success. Thanks to his noble heart and heed for danger, Robin became rapidly known as the protector of the poor and oppressed. Beloved and highly esteemed not only by the villagers, but also and especially by the sweet and beautiful Marian he was. The boy who never parted from his loyal, magical bow, endlessly engaged in dangerous and unthinkable missions.","background":null,"season":"summer","year":1990,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":"Unknown"},"producers":[{"mal_id":111,"type":"anime","name":"NHK","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/111\/NHK"}],"licensors":[],"studios":[{"mal_id":103,"type":"anime","name":"Tatsunoko Production","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/103\/Tatsunoko_Production"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":2,"type":"anime","name":"Adventure","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/2\/Adventure"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":13,"type":"anime","name":"Historical","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/13\/Historical"}],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":2544,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2544\/Kazoku_Robinson_Hyouryuuki__Fushigi_na_Shima_no_Flone","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1191\/98626.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1191\/98626t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1191\/98626l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1191\/98626.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1191\/98626t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/1191\/98626l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"title":"Kazoku Robinson Hyouryuuki: Fushigi na Shima no Flone","title_english":"The Swiss Family Robinson: Flone of the Mysterious Island","title_japanese":"\u5bb6\u65cf\u30ed\u30d3\u30f3\u30bd\u30f3\u6f02\u6d41\u8a18\u3075\u3057\u304e\u306a\u5cf6\u306e\u30d5\u30ed\u30fc\u30cd","title_synonyms":["Sekai Meisaku Gekijou","Robinson Family Lost at Sea: Flone of the Marvelous Island","Swiss Family Robinson (TV)"],"type":"TV","source":"Novel","episodes":50,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1981-01-04T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1981-12-27T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":4,"month":1,"year":1981},"to":{"day":27,"month":12,"year":1981}},"string":"Jan 4, 1981 to Dec 27, 1981"},"duration":"24 min per ep","rating":"G - All Ages","score":7.28,"scored_by":2378,"rank":2586,"popularity":7021,"members":5723,"favorites":22,"synopsis":"10-year-old Flone is a very active, tomboyish sort of a girl.

The \"story\" is that a manga artist is asked by her boss to accompany him and a travel-writer on various train trips around Japan and draw a manga about it. The kicker though, is that it's completely non-fiction \u2014the creator really did go on all these trips, and the manga simply records what happened, with no embellishment. There's a little disclaimer at the front that says \"This is non-fiction, so I apologize for the lack of drama,\" and indeed, it mostly is just about them riding trains from place to place, waiting on platforms, etc. The \"travel writer\" turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals (e.g. visiting all stations on a line in a completely bizarre order to accomodate infrequent trains). The mangaka doesn't really care about trains; she's cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy (she mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben); he's completely gung-ho as long as he's following the schedule, and the inevitable conflicts are pretty entertaining. Throughout, though, it feels real \u2014if you've travelled by train in Japan it will all seem very familiar, not just the scenery, but also the atmosphere and feel\u2014 and the artist does a great job of pacing and applying little tweaks to keep it consistently entertaining. In an additional bit of recursiveness, some of the characters who show up in the manga (who of course are real people, who really did show up) do so because they (really) read previous episodes of the manga! In addition of course, you can learn about various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations; some of them really do look cool. There's always this vague sense of surreality about it however, the trips are all planned by the train-guy (goal: visit all 9,843 stations in Japan) who seems to consider everything as part of a checklist rather than an experience to be enjoyed. You learn a bit about train-otaku culture too; there's really only the one guy in the story, but train-otaku culture is a sort of constant peripheral presence.
