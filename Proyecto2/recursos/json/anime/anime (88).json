Gokudou does get his wishes, though not exactly in the fashion that he expected. The best thing he gets out of his wishes is Honou no Maken, a magical sword that enables its owner to do fire attacks and it can be summoned from anywhere in the world.

He gets whapped on the head a lot, especially by the fortuneteller who reappears throughout the series just to plague Gokudou it seems.
