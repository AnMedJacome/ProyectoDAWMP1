Headstrong school bad boy Shingo Tamai and his friend Ohira are determined not to be bullied into joining Matsuki's team; instead they set up a squad of their own, and at first play just for fun and struggle to keep up with Matsuki's team. As their skills progress, they play other teams and get stronger and craftier, until they face the crack Asakase high school squad and its star player Misugi Yan in the schools' final. In a tangle of subplots involving old rivalries and injuries, and a mixed-race player seeking his identity and his lost mother (who turns out to be in jail), Shingo develops his skills as a center forward and looks forward to playing a visiting Brazilian squad. He is seriously injured in a game, but his talent, which even the legendary Brazilian Pele recognizes, is equaled by his determination. With the help of a friend of his old rival Matsuki, he recovers to help the team to victory. Definitely melodrama rather than a sports series proper, this is the first in the line of Japanese soccer soaps that stretches to Captain Tsubasa and beyond. Based on a manga by Ikki Kajiwara and Kosei Sonoda.

But this peace is threatened by Big Fire, a cabal seeking world domination. Against Big Fire the International Police Organisation dispatches a collection of superpowered warriors and martial artists, together with Daisaku Kusama, inheritor and master of Earth's most powerful robot, Giant Robo. By capturing an abnormal Shizuma Drive which is essential to Big Fire's plans the IPO ignites a desperate conflict between the two groups. The coming battle will test Daisaku's resolve to the utmost, reveal the ghastly truth behind the creation of the Shizuma Drive, and bring human civilization to its knees! Giant Robo is a character-driven adventure in a retro-futuristic setting, drawing on influences from opera, kung-fu cinema, wuxia stories and classic mecha anime. It incorporates characters from the works of the manga author Mitsuteru Yokoyama but it is designed to be a stand-alone story.","background":null,"season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[{"mal_id":23,"type":"anime","name":"Bandai Visual","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/23\/Bandai_Visual"}],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/250\/Media_Blasters"},{"mal_id":467,"type":"anime","name":"Discotek Media","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/467\/Discotek_Media"},{"mal_id":595,"type":"anime","name":"NYAV Post","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/595\/NYAV_Post"},{"mal_id":947,"type":"anime","name":"Manga Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/947\/Manga_Entertainment"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":329,"type":"anime","name":"Phoenix Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/329\/Phoenix_Entertainment"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":1,"type":"anime","name":"Action","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/1\/Action"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":24,"type":"anime","name":"Sci-Fi","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/24\/Sci-Fi"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[{"mal_id":18,"type":"anime","name":"Mecha","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/18\/Mecha"},{"mal_id":31,"type":"anime","name":"Super Power","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/31\/Super_Power"}],"demographics":[{"mal_id":27,"type":"anime","name":"Shounen","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/27\/Shounen"}]},{"mal_id":2322,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/2322\/Giant_Robo_Gaiden_Ginrei","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/2584.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/2584t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/2584l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/2584.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/2584t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/10\/2584l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":null,"url":null,"embed_url":null,"images":{"image_url":null,"small_image_url":null,"medium_image_url":null,"large_image_url":null,"maximum_image_url":null}},"title":"Giant Robo Gaiden Ginrei","title_english":"Giant Robo: Ginrei Special","title_japanese":"\u30b8\u30e3\u30a4\u30a2\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30dc\u5916\u4f1d GinRei \u9280\u9234","title_synonyms":["Giant Robo: Gin-Rei Special","GinRei: The Animation"],"type":"OVA","source":"Manga","episodes":3,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1994-02-20T00:00:00+00:00","to":"1995-02-21T00:00:00+00:00","prop":{"from":{"day":20,"month":2,"year":1994},"to":{"day":21,"month":2,"year":1995}},"string":"Feb 20, 1994 to Feb 21, 1995"},"duration":"25 min per ep","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.02,"scored_by":1444,"rank":8935,"popularity":7811,"members":4387,"favorites":1,"synopsis":"In episode one, Ginrei's dress is stolen, only to be used to fool the enemy.
