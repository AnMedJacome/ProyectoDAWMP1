Both are familiar with each other's work, though upon meeting each other, Seiji is shocked to find out that Sono is actually a man, ten years his senior. Love quickly blossoms between the two, but will soon be tested when Seiji begins to hear rumors about Sono's past sexual exploits. In the second tale, Koji Ueno is a part-time pet sitter, hired to take care of a rabbit named Aki for a new client. To Koji's complete surprise though, not only is there no rabbit in the house, but the only thing in the apartment is a bound and gagged man in the closet who says that he is Aki. More troubling than this is that Aki informs Koji that they are both in danger of upsetting the client, and the only way for Koji to get out safely is for them to make love together. Two stories, four men, and the one emotion of love that unites them all in the new twists their lives have taken.","background":"The Sensitive Pornograph OVA is a direct adaptation of the first and fifth stories of the original manga.","season":null,"year":null,"broadcast":{"day":null,"time":null,"timezone":null,"string":null},"producers":[],"licensors":[{"mal_id":250,"type":"anime","name":"Media Blasters","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/250\/Media_Blasters"}],"studios":[{"mal_id":329,"type":"anime","name":"Phoenix Entertainment","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/producer\/329\/Phoenix_Entertainment"}],"genres":[{"mal_id":28,"type":"anime","name":"Boys Love","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/28\/Boys_Love"},{"mal_id":4,"type":"anime","name":"Comedy","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/4\/Comedy"},{"mal_id":8,"type":"anime","name":"Drama","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/8\/Drama"},{"mal_id":22,"type":"anime","name":"Romance","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/22\/Romance"},{"mal_id":12,"type":"anime","name":"Hentai","url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/genre\/12\/Hentai"}],"explicit_genres":[],"themes":[],"demographics":[]},{"mal_id":743,"url":"https:\/\/myanimelist.net\/anime\/743\/Umi_ga_Kikoeru","images":{"jpg":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/52359.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/52359t.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/52359l.jpg"},"webp":{"image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/52359.webp","small_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/52359t.webp","large_image_url":"https:\/\/cdn.myanimelist.net\/images\/anime\/5\/52359l.webp"}},"trailer":{"youtube_id":"tfkHiHjrqa8","url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=tfkHiHjrqa8","embed_url":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/tfkHiHjrqa8?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1","images":{"image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/tfkHiHjrqa8\/default.jpg","small_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/tfkHiHjrqa8\/sddefault.jpg","medium_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/tfkHiHjrqa8\/mqdefault.jpg","large_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/tfkHiHjrqa8\/hqdefault.jpg","maximum_image_url":"https:\/\/img.youtube.com\/vi\/tfkHiHjrqa8\/maxresdefault.jpg"}},"title":"Umi ga Kikoeru","title_english":"The Ocean Waves","title_japanese":"\u6d77\u304c\u304d\u3053\u3048\u308b","title_synonyms":["I Can Hear the Sea"],"type":"Special","source":"Novel","episodes":1,"status":"Finished Airing","airing":false,"aired":{"from":"1993-05-05T00:00:00+00:00","to":null,"prop":{"from":{"day":5,"month":5,"year":1993},"to":{"day":null,"month":null,"year":null}},"string":"May 5, 1993"},"duration":"1 hr 12 min","rating":"PG-13 - Teens 13 or older","score":6.55,"scored_by":62956,"rank":6122,"popularity":1597,"members":112607,"favorites":426,"synopsis":"In the city of Kouchi, high school student Taku Morisaki is going about his work when his friend Yutaka Matsuno calls and asks him to get to their school as soon as possible.

A shard went into Kai's eye. After that, he grew cold to those he loved. One night, the Snow Queen came in her carriage and took Kai back to her ice castle at the farthest north point of the world. Everyone in Kai and Gerda's village didn't know where he went and believed he died from drowning in the frozen-over lake. Gerda doesn't believe this, for she dreamed of seeing Kai enter the carriage.

Inside, he finds an opaque cocoon that breaks on its own, and a dinosaur-like robot known as an \"Organoid\" emerges from the shell. Van names the creature Zeke and claims it for himself, but a group of bandits come after him to seize the Organoid. The bandits are equipped with \"Zoids,\" beast-like mechanical units that are used for combat. Van is able to fend off his pursuers by reviving and fusing with an old Zoid dubbed the \"Shield Liger.\" Van returns to the facility with Zeke in tow and finds a new cocoon. He is ecstatic that he may have obtained another Organoid, but when the cocoon breaks, a girl emerges from it instead. Unaware of her origins, the girl only remembers that her name is Fiona and that she has to locate an object called the \"Zoid Eve.\" Determined to solve the mystery behind her existence, Fiona ventures out alongside Van and Zeke to uncover what the Zoid Eve truly is. The trio runs across many friends and foes in their adventure, encountering various dangers and experiencing slices of light-heartedness as they travel.
